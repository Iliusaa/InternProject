# Asset: ui_door_indicator_locked

## Purpose
Locked north exit indicator.

## Gameplay or UI Context
HUD feedback used to communicate door state, blocked movement, or player damage.

## Pixel Dimensions
| Variant or State | Width px | Height px | Notes | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| locked | 128 | 128 | Feedback asset size. | inferred_from_layout |

## Placement and Anchor Rules
Door indicators anchor near north exit or top-center feedback zone. Edge flash stretches full screen. Keep feedback out of joystick zones.

## Visual Description
barred lock marker with dark stone crossbar and muted danger accent. Thick ink edges and strong shape language so state does not rely only on color.

## States and Variants
- `locked`: locked state or variant

## Sprite Sheet or Export Plan
Export as PNG/RGBA with transparent background. Canvas size: 128x128 px unless the generation tool requires a larger clean source. Pivot: center. Target output filename: `ui_door_indicator_locked.png`. Readability: must remain readable at 64x64 px on a phone screen. Do not bake labels such as Start Run, Buy, Score, Coins, Pause, Restart, Upgrade, Room, prices, scores, health values, or room numbers into the sprite; all labels and numbers must remain Unity UI text.

## Generation Prompt
Create `ui_door_indicator_locked` for Stackspire as original 2D dark fantasy mobile game art, fixed 2D three-quarter top-down perspective where relevant, grotesque hand-drawn proportions, thick uneven black ink outlines, scuffed painterly dungeon texture, grim candlelit tower mood, mobile-readable silhouette. Subject: barred lock marker with dark stone crossbar and muted danger accent. Intended use: Game HUD. Palette: ink void #0E0B10 #17131A #262129, dungeon stone #343038 #4B4447 #6D6461, Warrior dark crimson #6E151D #9E2527, damage red #D64A32 reserved only for damage and urgent feedback, torch and coin gold #8F5A24 #C18432 #E0B75C, Archer sickly green #35533B #587642 #8A9B55, Mage occult blue-violet #26364F #415C78 #7B6A9B, bone and parchment #B8A487 #D6C6A1. Background rule: transparent background for a reusable sprite or UI element; do not use #00FF00 in final visuals unless it is a raw removable chroma-key background that will be removed before Unity import. Composition and readability: state-specific feedback sprite with transparent background and no readable text. no readable text, no numbers, no watermark, do not copy existing game characters, UI symbols, logos, or proprietary designs. Do not bake labels such as Start Run, Buy, Score, Coins, Pause, Restart, Upgrade, Room, prices, scores, health values, or room numbers into the sprite; all labels and numbers must remain Unity UI text.

## Negative Prompt
photorealistic, 3D render, blurry, readable text, watermark, extra limbs, deformed, low quality, noisy background, realistic gore, body horror, dismemberment, exposed organs, lingering gore piles, copied game characters, copied UI symbols, copied logos, proprietary designs
